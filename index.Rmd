## Welcome to R

```{r setchunkoptions, cache=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(knitcitations)
opts_chunk$set(fig.width=14, fig.height=5)
bib <- read.bibtex("r-mar2013.bib")
```

Hopefully by now you've started up RStudio (or your IDE or text editor of choice) and are greeted by a command prompt:

## Say Hello!

As is traditional in programming, we'll start off with a `Hello world!` program. Try the below:

```{r}
print("Hello world!")
```

Congratulations! You've taken your first steps into R. You've used the function `print` to print the text "Hello world!" to the screen. Functions are basically like verbs in language, they tell R to do something. Notice the brackets `()` after the name of the function in which you can tell the function what to do.

Don't worry too much about the `[1]` at the beginning, we'll explain that soon. Note that you can also type `"Hello world!"` without the `print` command and R will assume you meant to print it.

---

## Some basic maths

We can also use R as a calculator for addition and powers:

```{r}
2 + 2
2 ^ 3
```

Note that there are other operators we can use, like `*` for multiplications, `-` for subtraction and `/` for division.

## Quick quiz

We'll be having a few quizzes like this during this tutorial. No pressure, it's just to check your understanding. Click 'Submit' to check if your answer is right. If you give up 'Check answer' will give you an answer. 'Clear' will allow you to start that quiz from scratch.

### What is the expected result from `6 / 2`?

1. 1
2. 2
3. _3_
4. 4

*** explanation

It's 3, because $\frac{6}{2} = 3$.

---

## Assigning variables

So now we can do some maths, but we don't want to have to remember the results every time. So let's store some as variable, so we can refer to them by name. To assign, we can use either the `=` or `<-` operator (though `<-` is recommended).

```{r}
core_volume <- 100
core_mass <- 180
bulk_density <- core_mass / core_volume

bulk_density
```

Note that assignment doesn't print the variable to the console.

---

## Not just numbers

R doesn't just work with numbers, it can also work with "strings" or characters. Strings are denoted by the quotes (`""`) surrounding them. We've already used these when we made our "Hello world!" program. In fact, we can use the `paste` function to stick them together. 

```{r}
paste("The bulk density is:", 1.75, sep=" ")
```

The `paste` function sticks strings and numbers together into a single string. The `sep` argument says: "Put a space between all of the things I'm sticking together".

---

## Making readable results

Let's combine all the things we know so far into something useful. Remember the bulk density we calculated earlier?

```{r}
paste("The bulk density is:", bulk_density, sep=" ")
```

Here R evaluated our variable `bulk_density` and added it to the string we were trying to make.

---&radio .quiz

## Quiz 2

### Which of these lines of code will produce the result: `"1:2:3:x:y:z"`

1. _paste(1, 2, 3, "x", "y", "z", sep=":")_
2. paste("123xyz", sep=":")
3. paste(1, 2, 3, x, y, z, sep=":")
4. paste(1, 2, 3, "x", "y", "z")

*** explanation

The first option. The second option won't work as there's only one string, so R can't place separators between strings. The third option is trying to call variables named `x`, `y` and `z` (but it's likely none exist). Finally, the fourth option is space-separated, not colon-separated.

---

## Bigger data

So we've been dealing with individual strings and numbers, let's move onto combining those into vectors. A vector is basically just a 1-dimensional array of data. Like a set of numbers or a shopping list. It's really easy to make vectors of sequential integers:

```{r}
1:10
5:-5
```

---

## More vectors

You can also make vectors of strings or numbers using the combine (`c`) function:

```{r}
c(5, 4, 3, 2, 8)
c("sand", "silt", "clay")
```

---

## Limits of atomic vectors

But be careful. These kinds of vectors can only take one type of data. If you combine numbers and strings together:

```{r}
c("SOILID001", 3, 5, "SOILID006", 7)
```

Then they all become characters.

If you think about it, you can treat numbers as letters, but it's a lot harder to treat letters as numbers.

---

## Even bigger data

Now that we can make vectors we can make subsets of bigger datasets, matrices and dataframes. Just to start off, we'll use a simple dataset which comes with R: `trees` (Try `?trees` for more information about the data). It is a data frame, a collection of vectors as columns. The vectors are allowed to be different types (character, integer, numeric), but they must all be the same length.

```{r}
trees
```

---

## Subsetting

The basic form of a subset is `object[whichrows, whichcolumns]`. Leaving an element blank means select all. So for example, to get the third row of `trees`, or the second column:

```{r}
trees[3, ]
trees[, 2]
```

You might have noticed the `[24]` in the second line of `trees[, 2]`. This indicates that the 72 next to it is the 24th element of that vector. There just isn't enough room on the screen to show it all in one line.

---

## Finer subsetting

We can get individual values by setting both rows and columns

```{r}
trees[3, 2]
trees[1, 1]
```

---

## The last elements

And we can also use `nrow` and `ncol` (gets the number of rows or columns) to get the last elements:

```{r}
nrow(trees)
trees[nrow(trees), ]
trees[, ncol(trees)]
```

---

## Why stop at one?

You can also subset collections of elements. To get the fourth to seventh row of the first and third column:

```{r}
trees[4:7, c(1, 3)]
```


---&radio .quiz

## Subsetting quiz

### What is the number in the third last row of the 2nd column of `trees`?

1. _80_
2. 87
3. 65
4. 10.3

***explanation

Using the line `trees[nrow(trees) - 2, 2]` will get you the third last row of the second column. Third last is the last one minus 2 places.

---

## Other ways of extracting columns

Data frames are collections of vectors, so you can use their names to extract them. You can use your original notation and also `$` notation (which is convenient, but not as powerful).

```{r}
trees[, "Height"]
trees$Height
```

---

## Subsetting by a conditional

Often, we want all the rows that meet a certain condition. Say I want all the trees where the height is greater than 82 ft. First, I can produce a TRUE/FALSE variable, then take only the cases where it is true:

```{r}
greater82 <- trees$Height  > 82
greater82[1:5]
trees[greater82, ]
```

---&radio .quiz

## Logical subsetting quiz

### How many trees are there with a girth less than 12.5 inches?

1. 3
2. 8
3. 0
4. _15_

***explanation

Using the code `trees[trees$Girth < 12.5, ]`, we can see that there are `r nrow(trees[trees$Girth < 12.5, ])` trees with a girth less than 12.5. Press 'p' to see the whole expected output.

***pnotes

```{r}
trees[trees$Girth < 12.5, ]
```

## Getting help

But how do I find out about all these functions? There are a few ways of getting help in R:

- The default help functions. Try `?print` or `help(print)`
- Other help functions: `RSiteSearch("soil")`
- StackOverflow
- The wonderful Google

At the moment, the help files will be fairly hard to get through, but they make more and more sense the more you use R. Some help files will be much simpler than others. If you find the help file impossible to get through, try testing the examples at the bottom of most help files or access them using the `examples` function.

---&radio .quiz

## Getting help quiz

### What does the `sep` argument of `read.csv` do?

 1. Separates the arguments with commas and puts them together
 2. _Determines the field separator character of a file which has been read in_
 3. Decides whether to use the Sepine Angulator algorithm
 4. If TRUE, splits files into list elements
 
*** explanation

 The `read.csv` function entry found using `?read.csv` or `help(read.csv)` says `sep` is the 'field separator character'.

## Fun to look forward to:

When you have a bit more R experience, you can make graphs like the following:

* Dates
* RGoogleVis (done)
* This presentation
* Soil graphs (from different data)
* Map with points in R

---

## googleVis

We can make your first plot a lot fancier if we want (hover your mouse over it):

```{r, results='asis', cache=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(googleVis))

soiltempdata <- read.csv("soiltempdata.csv", skip=16, na.strings=c(6999, 7777))

soiltempdata <- transform(soiltempdata, Time=strptime(paste0(Year, "-", Month, "-", Day, " ", sprintf("%02i", Hour), ":00:00"), tz="America/Anchorage", format="%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"))

depths <- paste0(c(0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 135, 150), " cm")
names(soiltempdata)[grep("^Depth", names(soiltempdata))] <- depths

# Remove depth 100 as it's empty
soiltempdata <- soiltempdata[, !grepl("100 cm", names(soiltempdata), fixed=TRUE)]
newdepths <- depths[!grepl("100 cm", depths, fixed=TRUE)]

# names(gvistempdata)[grep("Depth.0.cm", names(gvistempdata), fixed=TRUE)] <- "Temperature"

M <- gvisLineChart(soiltempdata, xvar="Time", yvar=newdepths, options=list(width=1000, height=500, lineWidth=0.5, vAxis="{title:'Temperature'}", hAxis="{title:'Time'}", title="Alaskan surface soil temperature"))

print(M, "chart")
```
